    <h1>Why do i wish to learn Web Development</h1>
    <p>This is one of those questions which i always get from my friends.</p>
    <p>
      To answer this question. I would first like to tell you about my life
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>So about a millennia ago, ok so ok.</p>
    <p>I will be serious now.</p>
    <p>So, I got my first computer when i was in 3rd or 4th grade.</p>
    <p>
      I was fascinated by the thing that was in front of me. My father bought
      this computer for his work. So, every time when he didn't have any work to
      do with it. I would use it because i was fascinated by that "thing".
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I really loved to that computer and I eventually developed a
      passion for computer so much so that I was set on to develop this hobby of
      mine in a career.
    </p>
    <h2>Ok yes good story, why chose web development specifically?</h2>
    <p>Yeah about that, I want to be a web developer because</p>
    <p>I FREAKING LOVE THE WEB!</p>
    <p>
      THE WEB ALWAYS FASCINATES ME TO THE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE A LIVING OUT
      OF IT!
    </p>
    <p>PLUS I HAVE FULL FREEDOM TO DO ANYTHING WHICH I WISHED TO BE!.</p>
